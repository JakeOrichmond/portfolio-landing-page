	<h2>Projects I have made</h2>
	<p>I have made a lot of random projects. Some finished to completion. Some not finished. Some that just ended up as some text and finally some apps that I got lost while creating in my first days of coding. I am a ninja.</p>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>The infamous "About Me" section. Well what about me? Should I tell you about what sports I have competed in? What about the places I have traveled? how about my favorite book? Mayybe about my son? Do you want to know my coding skills and history? Can you really learn anything from an about me section? I guess. Maybe. Does it help with anything? Can it give you a bad impression right from the get go or does it give you a good impression?</p>

	<p>Well I guess a little about me. My history as a coder started in June of 2015. I had completed Learn Python The Hard Way and found out that I was interested in learning how to make things happen on a computer screen. I did a Full Stack Python boot camp and found out that the back end world wasn't for me. It just wasn't my style. I like making things happen and watch them change and develop. I couldn't do that with python, or at least I didn;t </p>
